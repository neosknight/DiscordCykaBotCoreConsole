Warrenty
---------
- I take no responsibility for any kind of damage caused by BeSweet. 
  Use this program at your own risk!
- This package holds a *beta* BeSweet binary, and probably isn't bugless.
  for a bugs-free binary, use BeSweet v1.4.
- I take no, and can't take any, responsibility for anything related to
  the 3rd party DLLs supported by BeSweet.exe
- Beware : Using this program to violate copyrights is illegal. 
  You can only use this program for educational purpose.


Distribution
------------
- You may not distribute BeSweet without having an explicit permission from me.
- Usually i would almost automaticly agree for developers to include BeSweet in their packages if the following exists :
-- The whole BeSweet package is included. (including all licensing textfiles)
-- BeSweet version is a release and not a beta.
-- The program is a freeware and not commercial in any mean.
-- There's an active link to my website, so that users can download the latest releases.
- Pay attention that i have my ways to test audio streams and find out if BeSweet was involved in their creation process. therefore, i would strongly advise you to simply contact me before using my work.
