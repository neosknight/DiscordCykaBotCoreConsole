this manual lists all the available switches under the -split( ) section of BeSweet v1.5.
beware : switches are case-sensitive.

-start TIME
-----------

Default: 0

This sets the start-time offset of the track.
Value is set in seconds.

-end END
---------

Default: end

This sets the end-time offset of the track.
Value is set in seconds.


note that time values are absolute. 
for instance, a command including -split( -start 6 -end 10 ), will end up with a track of 4 seconds long.
