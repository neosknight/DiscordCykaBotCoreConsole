this manual lists all the available switches under the -ogg( ) section of BeSweet v1.5.
use this to encode Ogg Vorbis streams.

beware : switches are case-sensitive.


-b BITRATE
-----------

Default: Not Set.

This controls the nominal bitrate of the encoded Ogg track.
Bitrates should be treated as KBPS. for example -ogg( -b 128 ).


-m BITRATE
-----------

Default: Not Set.

This controls the minimum bitrate of the encoded Ogg track.
Bitrates should be treated as KBPS. for example -ogg( -m 64 ).


-M BITRATE
-----------

Default: Not Set.

This controls the maximum bitrate of the encoded Ogg track.
Bitrates should be treated as KBPS. for example -ogg( -M 192 ).


-q QUALITY
-----------

Default: Not Set.

This sets the desired quality of the OGG stream.
Quality values should vary from 0 to 1. 
-ogg( -q 0 ) will produce the smallest ogg filesizes.
-ogg( -q 1 ) will produce the biggest ogg filesize.


-6ch
-----
Default: Not Set.

This sets BeSweet to produce a 5.1 Vorbis stream.
