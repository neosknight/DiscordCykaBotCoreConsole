  Shibatch library by Naoki Shibata & DSPguru.

includes :

1.  A fast and high quality sampling rate converter SSRC
                                           written by Naoki Shibata

<Features>
  This program converts sampling rate of PCM wav file. Also, this program has
a function to apply dither to its output and extend perceived dynamic range.
  Sampling rates of 44.1kHz and 48kHz are populary used, but ratio of these
two frequency is 147:160, and it's not a small numbers. Therefore, sampling
rate conversion without degradation of sound quality requires filter with very
large order, and it's difficult to achive both quality and speed. This program
achived relatively fast and high quality with two different kinds of filters
combined skillfully.

2.  Shibatch Super Equalizer ver 0.03 

Shibatch Super Equalizer is a graphic and parametric equalizer plugin
for winamp. This plugin uses 16383th order FIR filter with FFT algorithm.
It's equalization is very precise. Equalization setting can be done
for each channel separately.
